# Music Muter

## TODO

1. The check if the last recorded track == the current track doesn't seem to be working (so we spam the logs in debug mode, oh well)
2. Allow right clicking on the current track to mute it, too
3. Update the volume slider to reflect the muted status
4. Add more configuration options
5. Color/label muted tracks
